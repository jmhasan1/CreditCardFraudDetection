<h3>Work Flow</h3>


<p>Credit Crad Data -------> Data Preprocessing  ------------> Data Analysis  ------------->  Train/Test Split -------------->   Logisic Regression Model  ---------------->   Evaluation</p>


<h5> Data Preprocessing </h5> 
<p> This dataset is very unbalanced, we need to balance this unbalanced datasets.</p>

<h5>Data Analysis</h5>
<p>Understand various features present in the dataset, relation between various dataset. Gives institution about the dataset we are using.</p>
<h5>Train/Test Split </h5>
<p> Feed the training data to our ML model, and then evaluate the performance / accuracy of the model on test data</p>
<h5>Logisic Regression Model</h5>
<p>Feed training data to Logistic Regression model, as it is binary classification problem, predict whether a particular transaction is legit or fraudulent.</p>
<h5>Evaluation</h5>
<p>Evaluate our model based on test data to check the performance of our model.</p>
